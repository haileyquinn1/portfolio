              College is hard, and it becomes even harder when you're broke and hungry. 
              With FoodFindr, we aim to make the hunt for FREE food easy and fun, 
              and help you find some interesting events around your college campus. 
              FoodFindr allows you to use your current location, or select the college 
              you attend, to bring up a map of where free food can be found around campus

              <h3>ChefMates - App Idea</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              In light of the COVID-19 pandemic forcing many people into quarantine and 
              unable to see their friends and family, we noticed that people were feeling 
              more disconnected than ever. We wanted to create an application that allowed 
              passionate cooks and food lovers to be able to connect with one another at a 
              time where many are at cooking at home, or looking to pick up the hobby. We 
              want to provide users with an interface that allows them to virtually cook 
              together and enjoy each otherâ€™s company.

              <h3>GimmeTV - App Redesign</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              During my time at Michigan, I've been a part of Reach Consulting Group. We 
              work with local businesses and organization to help with problems related 
              to technology, strategy, finance, and management. For this specific project, 
              my teams client was creating a new application that was similar to a Tinder 
              for TV shows, in order to help recommend new shows for users. When the 
              client came to us, they had a working app, but wanted to perform more user 
              testing to make sure their design was strong, and users were understanding.
