				<h3>Our Project</h3>
			  </header>
			  <p>
				During my time at Michigan, I've been a part of Reach Consulting Group. 
				We work with local businesses and organization to help with problems 
				related to technology, strategy, finance, and management. For this 
				specific project, my teams client was creating a new application that 
				was similar to a Tinder for TV shows, in order to help recommend new 
				shows for users. When the client came to us, they had a working app, but 
				wanted to perform more user testing to make sure their design was strong, 
				and users were understanding.
